    "**Benefits of Metadata:**\n",
    "\n",
    "- *Enhanced Retrieval*: Metadata provides additional context about the primary data, which significantly improves the accuracy and relevance of the information retrieved. This is particularly important in RAG, where the goal is to retrieve data that is relevant to a user's query and provide it as context for the LLM. By incorporating metadata, the system can better understand the nuances of the query and retrieve data that is more likely to be relevant to the user's needs. For example, knowing the `main_speaker`, `title`, and `speaker_occupation` can offer insights into the content of the `transcript`.\n",
    "\n",
    "- *Improved Response Generation*: The addition of metadata to the data chunks being processed by the LLM allows for a more nuanced and context-aware retrieval process. This leads to higher quality outcomes in response generation, as the LLM is able to draw upon a richer understanding of the context in which the data is being retrieved.\n",
    "\n",
    "- *Reduced Hallucinations*: By grounding the LLM's output on relevant, external knowledge, RAG attempts to mitigate the risk of responding with incorrect or fabricated information (`hallucinations`). The use of metadata helps to ensure that the responses generated by the LLM are based on accurate and relevant information, rather than simply relying on static training data.\n",
    "\n",
    "- *Domain-Specific Responses*: Metadata can be used to provide domain-specific, relevant responses tailored to an organization's proprietary or domain-specific data. This is particularly important in applications where the LLM needs to provide responses that are specific to a particular domain or industry.\n",
    "\n",
    "- *Efficiency and Cost-Effectiveness*: RAG is a simple and cost-effective approach to customizing LLMs with domain-specific data. By leveraging metadata, organizations can deploy RAG without needing to customize the model, which is especially beneficial when models need to be updated frequently with new data."
